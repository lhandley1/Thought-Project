# Thought Project
## Summary
My Third React Project assisted by Codeacademy as part of the Learn React course. The task was to build a note-taking app where users can
write down their thoughts.

Functionalities include:
- **Adding Thoughts** - thoughts can be added via text input within the input area and are submited by pressing the add button.
- **Removing Thoughts** - thoughts are automatically removed after 15 seconds or can be manually removed by clicking the x in the right hand corner of one of the list items.
